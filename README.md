# Smart Property Management

This is a minimal demo project showing a basic property management system.
It contains a Node.js backend with a simple REST API and a static frontend
that visualizes sensor data using Chart.js.

## Folders
- `backend` – Express server and API endpoints
- `frontend` – static HTML/CSS/JS files for the dashboard and pages
- `data` – placeholder for future database files

## Running the server
From the `backend` directory run:

```bash
node server.js
```

Then open `frontend/index.html` in a browser to view the UI.
